  McDonald's is a fast food chain that was started in 1940. It serves millions of people with food, toys, and fun on a daily basis. The first location started in California, where they mostly served barbecue foods, but later switched to burgers. It was later acquired by Ray Kroc, who expanded the company's presence around the world. As of today they are the largest toy distributor and feed at least 1% of the population everyday.
